- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This was a simple task that required plain HTML and CSS, but i chose to use the longer route so i can become more familiar with the use of Next JS, typescript and tailwindCSS.

### Continued development

I look forward to building more tasks with this stackup.
